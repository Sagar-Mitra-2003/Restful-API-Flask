        "Token-Based Authentication:\n",

        "Thoroughly validate all incoming user input to prevent common attacks like SQL injection, NoSQL injection, and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).\n",
        "Sanitize Data:\n",
        "Cleanse user input by removing or escaping potentially malicious characters before using it in queries or displaying it on the client-side.\n",

        "Secure HTTP Headers:\n",
